# Primes

Welcome to my small implemtation of computing Prime Numbers using C

### How to run

Once you have cloned, you just need to run `make` and then `./primes.c` where you will get to try out for different values. Each run will apend to a file inside of `data`, where we have different values for different runs. 

### What else is included

We also have a python file which goes ahead shows the time complexity to compute these values. To run this, run `python3 graphs.py`
